# Security via State Collapse

This repository is part of the Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) corpus.

---

## Overview

This document presents **state collapse** as a primary security mechanism.
Rather than preventing execution, the system enforces security by rendering
violating states irreversible or non-propagating.

---

## Core Contributions

- Formal definition of state collapse.
- Localized and partial collapse mechanisms.
- Collapse as enforcement, finalization, and containment.
- Deterministic collapse behavior.
- Reduced reliance on access control.

---

## Security Philosophy

> Do not stop execution — make it unable to matter.

---

## Applications

- Intrusion containment  
- Fault isolation  
- Secure finalization of computation  
- Resilient execution models

---

## Status

Security-centric architectural specification.

---

## Relation to QFC

Implements the **irreversibility boundary** used throughout QFC security semantics.
